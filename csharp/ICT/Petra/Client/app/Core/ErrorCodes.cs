        #region DOCUMENTATION - read this when adding Error Codes for the first time!

        //
        // Error Codes are listed as string constants whose name can be used by the programmer
        // (code completion is available) and whose string value represents the error code itself.
        //
        // Decoration with an 'ErrCodeAttribute' is highly recommended, as it is documenting the
        // Error Code and makes automatic displaying of a whole error message with plain text
        // explanation for the user very easy!

        // An error code string consists of four sections:
        //  * 'GEN' - hard-coded value for General Error Codes that are application-wide within OpenPetra;
        //  * a full stop ('.');
        //  * a running five-digit number with leading zeroes which is *unique*;
        //  * a single character. 'V' denotes a data verification error, 'N' denotes a non-critical error,
        //   'E' denotes any other error.
