    /// Their role is to
    ///   - retrieve (and possibly aggregate) data using Business Objects,
    ///   - put this data into ///one/// DataSet that is passed to the Client and make
    ///     sure that no unnessary data is transferred to the Client,
    ///   - optionally provide functionality to retrieve additional, different data
    ///     if requested by the Client (for Client screens that load data initially
    ///     as well as later, eg. when a certain tab on the screen is clicked),
    ///   - save data using Business Objects.
    ///
    /// @Comment These Objects would usually not be instantiated by other Server
    ///          Objects, but only by the Client UI via the Instantiator classes.
    ///          However, Server Objects that derive from these objects and that
    ///          are also UIConnectors are feasible.
