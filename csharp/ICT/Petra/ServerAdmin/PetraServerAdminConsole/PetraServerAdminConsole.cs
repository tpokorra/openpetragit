// @Description:
//          PetraServerConsole.exe (Command line application) is the Middle Tier of Petra.NET.
//
//          Its purpose is to accept Petra Client connections and perform actions that
//          the Clients request. Business Objects in the Server read and write data to
//          the DB, the Client itself has no connection to the DB at all.
//
// @Comment This application can run both on Windows and Linux.
//          It uses only a rather small unit (PetraServerConsole.Main.pas) to start
//          the PetraServer as a Command line application. The 'big' rest of
//          the Server logic and the Petra Business Objects are located in
//          numeruous libraries (.dll's) that can be used by a Command line
//          application or any other form of .NET application (eg. WinForms) to
//          provide Petra Server functionality!
