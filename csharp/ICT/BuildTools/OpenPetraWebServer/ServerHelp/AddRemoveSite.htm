	<h1>Adding or Removing Web Sites</h1>
	
    <h4>This topic applies only to the Full GUI</h4>

    <p>You can run any number of web sites from the web server. The only restriction is that they must all use 
    a different port number.  Add a new web site to the web server by clicking on the main window menu and selecting the <b>Add Site&nbsp;...</b> item.
    The <b>Web Site Properties </b>dialog will be displayed.  You need to enter the following information.</p>
    <ul><li><b>A Friendly Name</b>: this is a unique name that identifies this entry in the list of installed web sites.  The name does not form part of the web address.</li>
    <li><b>The Physical Path</b>: this is the actual location on your hard drive that will be the root of the site.</li>
    <li><b>The Virtual Path</b>: this is the name of the site that will appear after localhost in the URL.  You can leave this entry blank.</li>
    <li><b>The Port Number</b>: this is the HTTP port that the server will listen on for web requests. The standard port is 80. Other favourite choices are 8080, 8888, 8088 
    but you can use any number, usually above 50000.  
    If you have more than one web site you must use a different port number for each one.</li>
    <li><b>The Default Page</b>: You can leave this blank, but if you do the server will try to locate a 'default.htm' or 'default.aspx' page or similar.  
    If it cannot find one of its default documents it will display a directory listing from which you can browse to a listed page.  
    You will usually want to supply a default page if the site home page is not one of the standard documents.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that you can only add a new web site when the server is stopped.</p>
    <p>You can remove a web site by selecting the site in the main window list and clicking the <b>Remove </b>item from the <b>Seleced Site </b>menu.</p>
    <p>The application saves your web site and option settings to disk.  When you run the application again it will start again from where you left off.</p>
