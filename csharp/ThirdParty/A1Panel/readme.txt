Quote from that site's Home Page (http://www.openwinforms.com/):
"OpenWinForms is a open source website for windows forms and controls. 
Here you can find windows controls and libraries for free. 
This is a non-commercial open source web site. 
This site mainly focuses on Microsoft technologies e.g. Microsoft .net, 
VB.net, C#.net etc. 
You may use these for any commercial or non-commercial purpose for free, 
however you cannot sell them directly or by modifying."


===OUR OWN MODIFICATIONS===
The source code in the /src/ directory got somewhat modified by ChristianK
so we get the 'look' we want for the 'Task' display on the right hand side 
of the OpenPetra Main Menu. 
The original source code can be found in the /src_original/ 
directory.
