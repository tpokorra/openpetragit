based on the source code of SourceGrid as of July 16, 2012
(found here: http://bitbucket.org/dariusdamalakas/sourcegrid/)


We have made two important modifications:
Please manually adjust the files in the downloaded source code of SourceGrid, based on the diff files included in this directory.

==== Include 'Fixed Rows' in the calculation of the Column's AutoSize ====
The file ColumnInfoCollection.cs contains a modification (by ChristianK) for Class 'ColumnInfoCollection'. 
This modification changes the calculation of the Column's AutoSize so that it is done in the way as SourceGrid 4.11 did it.
We want that behaviour so that the Column Header Texts are also taken into consideration,
ie. the Column Width can never be AutoSized smaller than the Header Text. This prevents
Columns from 'collapsing' to a few pixels width if there is no data in a particular column
(eg. Partner Find screen). 
From SourceGrid 4.20 onwards, Fixed Rows are excluded from the AutoSize calculation algorithm, which causes the mentioned problem of Columns collapsing if there is no data in them.

==== Fix a bug in the display or otherwise of the scrollbars ====
The file CustomScrollControl.cs contains a modification (by AlanP) that fixes a bug where the grid does not display the scrollbars correctly as the content of the grid changes.  
For example, if the grid already has a horizontal scrollbar but no need for a vertical one, and then you add rows, you reach a stage where at least one row is 'hidden' behind the horizontal scrollbar.


Other changes
-------------

==== A previous fix relating to Selection.Focus on leaving the Grid is no longer required ====
The file GridVirtual.cs (that we previously modified) no longer needs any change.
